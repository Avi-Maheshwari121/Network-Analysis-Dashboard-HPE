# Network Analysis Dashboard - HPE (NetPulse)

A real-time network monitoring dashboard that captures live packet data using **TShark** (a network protocol analyzer and command-line version of Wireshark). It computes vital network metrics such as **Throughput (Inbound/Outbound)**, **Latency**, **Packet Loss**, and **Jitter**, displaying them through live-updating visualizations.

The application features a raw data table for packet-level details, **Protocol-Wise Statistics**, and **Traffic Composition** (IPv4 vs. IPv6 and Encrypted vs. Unencrypted). It also maps the geographic location of public destination IP addresses and provides AI-powered summaries of network health generated by the **Gemini LLM**.

* Top 7 Outbound Conversations & Protocol Distribution
* Traffic Composition: IPv4/IPv6 and Encrypted/Unencrypted analytics
* Geographic Location Tracking via destination IP mapping
* AI-Powered Intelligence: Periodic summaries every 60 seconds via Gemini LLM
* Multi-tab UI: Dedicated views for Dashboard metrics, Raw Data filtering, Geo Maps, and Summary History

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** ReactJS
* **Backend:** Python
* **Packet Capture:** TShark
* **Connectivity:** WebSockets for live real-time updates
* **AI Engine:** Google Gemini LLM

---

## Requirements

Ensure the following are installed for local manual setup:

* Wireshark (includes TShark)
* Python 3.x
* Node.js & npm

---

## Installation & Setup

### Option 1: Native Executables (Windows & macOS)

For the simplest experience, we provide standalone `.exe` (Windows) and binary executables (macOS) in the GitHub **Releases** section.

* **Direct Execution:** These files can be run directly on your system without installing Python, Node.js, or other developer dependencies.
* **Native Integration:** Utilizes Npcap (Windows) and libpcap (macOS) for direct host network interface access.

---

### Option 2: Docker Deployment (Recommended for Linux)

Docker ensures **"Zero Visualization Overhead"** by accessing the host network interface directly.

1. Download `docker-compose.yml` from the latest GitHub Release
2. Run the application:

```bash
sudo docker-compose pull
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

> **Note:** Uses `network_mode: host` for raw packet access on Linux.

### Option 3: Manual Developer Setup

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avi-Maheshwari121/Network-Analysis-Dashboard-HPE.git
cd Network-Analysis-Dashboard-HPE
```

#### Backend Setup (Python)

```bash
cd Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

#### Frontend Setup (ReactJS)

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Launch:** Access the app at `http://localhost:5173`

## User Interface Overview

### Dashboard Tab

Displays real-time graphs and values of different network metrics:

* **Throughput:** Real-time values and charts for inbound and outbound traffic
* **Goodput:** Live values for successful data delivery
* **Packets per Second (PPS):** Tracking of packet transmission frequency
* **Protocol Distribution:** Interactive pie and bar charts
* **Top 7 Outbound Conversations:** Highest-volume data flows by destination
* **Network Health Summary:** Real-time AI observations on system performance

---

### Raw Data Tab

Provides packet-level visibility similar to Wireshark:

* **Data Fields:** Packet No., Timestamp, Source/Destination IP, Protocol, Length, Info
* **Advanced Filtering:** Filter by IP addresses, Protocols, or Info strings

---

### Protocol Stats Tab

Specialized metrics for deep protocol analysis:

* **TCP:** Average RTT Latency, Retransmissions, PPS, Current Throughput
* **UDP:** PPS and Current Throughput
* **RTP:** Jitter, Packet Loss, PPS, Throughput
* **QUIC, DNS, IGMP:** PPS and Throughput per protocol
* **Statistical Averages:** Peak and average values for session metrics

---

### Traffic Composition Tab

Visualizes the makeup of network traffic:

* **IP Version:** IPv4 vs IPv6 PPS and Throughput distribution
* **Security & Encryption:** Encrypted vs Unencrypted packet ratios

---

### Geo Map Tab

Displays geographic locations of public destination IP addresses:

* Interactive Traffic Geolocation Map
* Category-based filtering (Streaming, Social Media, Gaming)
* Tooltips showing IP address, App name, and Host name

---

### Summary History Tab

Persistent log of AI-generated insights:

* Timestamped summaries every 60 seconds
* Historical view of network health evolution
