# Network Analysis Dashboard - HPE

A real-time network monitoring dashboard that captures live packet data using `tshark` (a network protocol analyzer and command-line version of Wireshark), and computes important network metrics such as **Throughput**(*Inbound and Outbound*), **Goodput**(*Inbound and Outbound*), **Latency**, **Packet Loss**, and **Jitter**  and displays them with **live-updating visualizations** through graphs and charts. The application also includes a **raw data table** that shows packet-level details similar to Wireshark. Other features of the application
includes **Protocol-Wise Statistics**, **Traffic Composition**(*IPv4 vs IPv6 and Encrypted vs Unencrypted Packets*) and also displaying the **geographic location of public destination IP addresses**. Along with this, the user can see the **AI-powered summaries** about the network health generated by the llm.

## Features

- **Real-time Packet Capture** using `tshark` (Wireshark CLI)
- **Live Visualizations**:
  - Throughput, Packets Per Second, Latency and Jitter tracking 
  - Top 7 Outbound Conversations 
  - Protocol Distribution
  - IPv4 and IPv6 Traffic Composition
  - Encrypted and Unencrypted Packets Composition
  - Geographic Location Tracking by IP address
  - Updates every 2 seconds for real-time insights
- **Multi-tab UI**:
  - **Dashboard**: Interactive visualizations and metrics, and, LLM Summary of the Network Health
  - **Raw Data**: Details of the packet including Source IP Address, Destination IP Address and the Protocol and, filtering option to filter the packets
  - **Protocol Stats**: Protocol-Wise Metrics values and Visualizations
  - **Traffic Composition**: Composition of network traffic based on IPv4 and IPv6 Packets and based on Encrypted and Unencrypted Packets
  - **Geo Map**: Map for displaying the geographic location of public destination IP addresses, which also shows location pins along with their IP address, app name and host name
  - **Summary Bot**: Display summaries of the current capture session which will keeps on updating every 60 seconds
  - **Summary History**: All periodic insights generated during the current capture session generated by the summary bot are logged here 

## Tech Stack

http://localhost:5173
```

## User Interface Overview

### Dashboard Tab:
Display real-time graphs and values of different network metrics:

- Throughput (inbound and outbound) values and chart<br>
- Goodput (inbound and outbound) values<br>
- Packets per Second
- Protocol distribution pie chart and protocol distribution (count) bar chart<br>
- Top 7 Outbound Conversations (by Volume)
- Network Health Summary

### Raw Data Tab:
Display packet-level data in a structured table view, including fields like:

- Packet No.
- Timestamp
- Source IP
- Destination IP
- Protocol
- Length
- Info

Filter option to filter out the packets based on IP Address, Protocols and Info

### Protocol Stats Tab:
Display protocol-wise data with visualizations, including: 
- TCP: Average RTT Latency, Retransmissions, Packets per Second, Current Throughput(IN/OUT) along with visulaization
- UDP: Packets per Second, Current Throughput(IN/OUT) along with visualization
- RTP: RTP Jitter, Packet Loss, Packets per Second, Current Throughput(IN/OUT) along with visulaization
- QUIC: Packets per Second, Current Throughput(IN/OUT) along with Visualization
- DNS: Packets per Second, Current Throughput(IN/OUT) along with Visualization
- IGMP: Packets per Second, Current Throughput(IN/OUT) along with Visualization

The peak and average values of the metrics are also displayed here

### Traffic Composition Tab:
Display traffic composition with visualizations, including: 
- Composition of IPv4 and IPv6 metrics like Packets per Second and Throughput(IN/OUT) along with charts and IP composition pie chart
- Composition of Encrypted and Unencrypted Packets using pie chart.

### Geo Map Tab: 
Display the geographic location of public destination IP addresses captured during the entire session on the Traffic Geolocation Map
- Filter option to filter out the location pins based on different categories like streaming, social media, gaming etc.
- Hovering over a pin shows the app name with the ip address and the host name. 

### Summary History Tab:
All periodic insights generated during the current capture session are logged here, with the newest appearing first.
The new summary will keeps on displaying here with its timestamp.
